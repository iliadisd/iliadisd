<!-- Main text -->
I am an Electrical and Computer Engineer with great passion towards Computer Architecture. During my studies, I learned how to work in a group as well as solo, by completing several projects, mandatory for many courses of the Universityâ€™s Curriculum. This led to gaining a great piece of knowledge in several sectors by working with people that excel in what they currently do, as well as sharing my skills and contributing in anything that has to do with my strong suits. You can also find me on [LinkedIn.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dimosthenis-iliadis-apostolidis/)
